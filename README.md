ABC Pharmacy Management System is a web-based application designed to manage invoices and product inventory for a pharmacy. It is an assesment given to me from [21c Care (https://www.21ccare.com/)]. This system allows users to create, view, edit, and delete invoices, as well as manage product details associated with each invoice.

##Running the System
##Frontend
## To run the frontend:

1. Navigate to the frontend directory.
2. Install dependencies using npm install.
3. Start the development server using npm start.
4. Access the application at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

##Backend
##To run the backend:

1. Navigate to the backend directory.
2. Install dependencies using go mod tidy.
3. Start the backend server using go run main.go.
4. The server will start running at http://localhost:8080.


Usage
1. Creating Invoices
2. Editing Invoices
3. Deleting Invoices
4. Searching Invoices

Ensure that the backend server is running before accessing the frontend.
Make sure to configure the database connection details in the backend configuration file (config.json or .env file).
The system is designed for managing invoices and product inventory specifically for pharmacies. It may require customization to suit other types of businesses.
